The Difference Between an ICP and a Persona

Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) is about the type of business you want to work with.
Your persona is about the person inside that business who makes the decisions or feels the pain you solve.

Example 1: Your Supplements Company

Your ICP might be small, independent health stores or boutique gyms that want to offer high-quality or unique supplements. These stores care about standing out from big retail chains and keeping their shelves full of products that actually sell.

Your persona, on the other hand, is the store owner or purchasing manager. This person is the one who decides what products to bring in. Theyâ€™re probably busy, cautious about new products, and worried about wasting shelf space or money on something that might not sell. What they really want is something that moves quickly, looks good, and brings customers back.

So:

The ICP is the kind of store.

The persona is the human who decides what goes on the shelf.

Example 2: Your IT MSP for Animal Hospitals and Labs

Your ICP here would be small to mid-sized animal hospitals or medical laboratories that donâ€™t have a full time IT department. These organizations depend on technology for their daily work but struggle with slow systems, security issues, or compliance headaches.

Your persona is the clinic owner, practice manager, or lab operations director. Theyâ€™re the ones staying late to fix the Wi-Fi, worrying about data loss, or panicking when something breaks. They donâ€™t want to deal with IT â€” they just want things to work smoothly so they can focus on patients or lab results.

So:

The ICP is the type of organization.

The persona is the person inside it who feels the pain and can say yes.

The Simple Rule

ðŸ‘‰ ICP = the kind of business you go after.
ðŸ‘‰ Persona = the person you talk to.

The ICP tells you where to hunt.
The persona tells you how to speak their language.
