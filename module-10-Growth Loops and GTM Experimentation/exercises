Create Your First Hypothesis

Pick a simple marketing idea (like changing a headline or email subject).

Write this formula:
If I [change action], then [metric] will increase by [expected %] because [reason].

If I change the headline on our main landing page to include a specific benefit, 
then the conversion rate will increase by 15% because a clear, benefit-driven headline will immediately grab the user's attention and reduce their cognitive load,
making the value proposition instantly understandable.

RealtySense: Proof-of-Performance Growth Loop

Product: RealtySense (AI Automation Tool for Real Estate Agents)
Core Value: Instantly generates high-converting property descriptions, personalized buyer reports, and data-driven social media ad copy, saving agents 10+ hours per week.
Motivation for Sharing: Pride, Visibility, and Referral Reward. Agents are competitive and want to show off their quick sales or superior marketing materials.

The Growth Loop Mechanism

User (Agent A) Receives Value: Agent A uses RealtySense to generate a market analysis report for a potential seller, or an advanced, data-driven property description for a new listing.

Performance/Success Trigger: The listing generates 20% more buyer inquiries than the agent's previous listings, or the seller is immediately impressed by the quality of the AI-generated report, leading to a signed contract.

Automatic Sharing Integration: The final AI-generated report or description automatically includes a discreet, professionally branded call-to-action at the bottom: "Data analysis powered by RealtySense AI. See how it works."

Exposure to New Visitor (Agent B): Agent A posts the high-performing listing/report on their LinkedIn, Facebook group, or email newsletter. Agent B (a competitor or colleague) sees the professional, high-converting content.

New Visitor Conversion: Agent B clicks the "Powered by RealtySense AI" link, lands on a dedicated landing page showing the exact template/tool used, and starts a free trial.

Monetization & Re-engagement: Agent B converts to a paid user and immediately begins generating high-quality content, continuing the loop.




t, the answer combines the high quality of the AI output (Pride/Visibility) with a direct incentive to overcome professional competitive friction (Referral Reward)
