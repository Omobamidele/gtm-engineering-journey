Intermediate:
Create a Lean GTM Canvas for a fictional SaaS app (e.g., AI email assistant).

SOLUTION
Problem: Professionals across sales, recruiting, and support roles spend ≈2.5 hours daily drafting highly repetitive, yet mission-critical, emails (follow-ups, confirmations, scheduling). This manual effort reduces their focus on core tasks, bottlenecks revenue-generating activities, and causes communication latency.

Target ICP (Ideal Customer Profile): Mid-market ($10M−$100M ARR) B2B Sales Development/Account Executives and High-Volume Corporate Recruiters (companies with 10−50 person sales/recruiting teams). These users are already heavily integrated into CRM systems and measure success by rapid, personalized outreach.

Solution: An AI Co-pilot integrated directly into Gmail/Outlook and Salesforce/HubSpot via a sleek browser extension. It anticipates the user's need based on context (conversation history, CRM data) and drafts complete, personalized emails from a 1−2 bullet point prompt, automatically applying the right tone and brand voice.

Unique Value Prop (UVP): We don't just auto-complete sentences—we auto-draft entire, personalized emails in seconds. We guarantee a 75% reduction in email drafting time compared to using standard templates, allowing users to handle 2× the volume without quality loss.

Channel(s):

Product-Led Growth (PLG): A generous free tier distributed via the Google Workspace Marketplace and Microsoft AppSource (low friction adoption).

Direct Sales: Targeted outbound campaigns on LinkedIn towards SDR/Recruiting leadership, focusing on the team efficiency gain.

Affiliate/Partner: Integrations with popular CRM and sales engagement platforms.

Pricing Model: Freemium → Per-User Subscription.

Free: Limited to 50 AI-generated emails/month (PLG hook).

Pro Tier ($29/user/mo): Unlimited emails, advanced features (tone control, multilingual support), and CRM data integration.

Team Tier ($49/user/mo): Everything in Pro, plus centralized billing and team-wide custom brand voice training.

Key Metric(s):

Time Saved (Efficiency): Average time to draft per email (must be <10 seconds).

Engagement/Quality: Reply rate increase vs. previous manual campaigns.

Adoption & Stickiness: Monthly Active Users (MAU) and the percentage of users who use the AI for >50% of their outbound emails.



Advanced:
Analyze your favorite PLG product and identify its activation metric (like Slack’s 2k messages).

SOLUTION

My favorite PLG product is Make.com, the Activation meric is the moment a user moves from browsing the potential of the tool to actually building and running their own automated workflow.

The "Aha!" Moment: For a Make.com user, the "Aha!" moment isn't just signing up, it's seeing data move automatically between two apps that they set up.

The Metric: Therefore, the activation is specifically: A user successfully creates and turns on (activates) their first working Scenario/Workflow
