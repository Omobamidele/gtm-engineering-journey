AnchorPoint: Relationship Security App Playbook

Product

Target

AnchorPoint (Digital tools for managing Anxious Attachment)

Individuals (25-45) actively dating or in relationships who identify with Anxious Attachment Style and are seeking practical self-regulation tools.

🔑 Key Benefits (The Core Value)

Use these three points to instantly frame the product as essential and unique:

Immediate Relief: Access to a "Panic Button" module that provides structured, real-time distress reduction tools for moments of high anxiety or triggering.

Secure Pattern Building: Daily, personalized Guided Check-ins and Thought Reframing exercises designed to gradually build secure, resilient relational habits.

Therapy Complement: Functions as a highly accessible "homework" or 24/7 support tool that documents triggers and progress for more productive clinical sessions.

🎤 Objection Responses (Instant Rebuttals)

❌ Objection

🎯 Response (Shift the Focus)

“I already see a therapist/coach.”

“That’s fantastic. AnchorPoint actually complements therapy by providing instant, actionable coping mechanisms right when a trigger hits, which you can then log and discuss for more impactful sessions.”

“I don't think an app can truly help—I just need to communicate better.”

“Effective communication starts with internal regulation. AnchorPoint’s core mission is to help you manage the intense emotional state so that your communication is non-reactive, calm, and clear, leading to better results.”

“I’m worried about sharing sensitive data.”

“We prioritize your safety. All check-ins and logs are anonymized by default and stored securely. Your data is never shared, ensuring a completely private space for self-work.”

🚀 Goal

The primary goal of this playbook is to ensure every rep can articulate the product's value (24/7 self-regulation) and overcome the key objection (already having a therapist) in under 30 seconds. This allows them to quickly pivot to discussing the Free 7-Day Self-Regulation Jumpstart trial.

Sales Tip

When prospects mention a recent relationship trigger, immediately validate their feeling, then ask: "Did you have a reliable tool in that moment to pause and re-center? That's precisely when AnchorPoint steps in."
