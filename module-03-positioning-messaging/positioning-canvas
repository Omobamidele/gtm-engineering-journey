The Positioning Framework (April Dunford’s Methodology)

Competitive Alternatives — What would customers use if you didn’t exist?

Unique Attributes — What do you offer that others don’t?

Value — What value do those attributes create for customers?

Customers Who Care — Who cares most about that value?

Market Category — What type of product are you?

Outcome — What transformation do you create?
