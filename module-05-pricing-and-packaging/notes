Pricing isn’t just about numbers, it’s about how customers perceive your value.



Pricing Psychology — How Humans Think About Price
| Concept           | Explanation                                            | Example                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Anchoring**     | Show a high price first, so the real one feels cheaper | "$99" crossed out → "$49"                |
| **Decoy Pricing** | Add a middle plan to push users to the higher one      | $10 / $20 / $22 — people pick $22        |
| **Framing**       | Highlight savings or value                             | “Just $1/day” instead of “$30/month”     |
| **Charm Pricing** | End in .99                                             | $9.99 feels cheaper than $10             |
| **Bundling**      | Combine features together                              | “Pro plan includes templates + AI tools” |

| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Pricing is value communication     | Not just numbers                    |
| Start simple                       | 3 plans max                         |
| Test, measure, repeat              | Pricing evolves                     |
| Use psychology wisely              | People buy what *feels* fair        |
| Always tie price to customer value | Don’t sell features — sell outcomes |
