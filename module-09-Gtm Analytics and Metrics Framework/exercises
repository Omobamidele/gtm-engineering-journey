üß† Intermediate Exercise: Calculate Your CAC & LTV

Pick a fictional product and estimate:

Spend on marketing: $1,000

Customers gained: 20

CAC = $1,000 √∑ 20 = $50

Each customer pays $10/month, stays 12 months ‚Üí
LTV = $10 √ó 12 = $120

LTV:CAC = 120 √∑ 50 = 2.4√ó

üéØ Goal: See how lifetime value justifies acquisition costs.




SOLUTION
calculation of the Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), and the LTV:CAC ratio based on the provided metrics for your product, the AI Agent for Healing Anxious Attachment:1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)The CAC is the total cost of sales and marketing efforts required to acquire a customer.Spend on Marketing: $\$1,000$Customers Gained: $20$CAC $= \frac{\text{Spend on Marketing}}{\text{Customers Gained}}$CAC $= \frac{\$1,000}{20} = \$50$$\text{Your cost to acquire one customer is **\$50**}.$2. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)The LTV is the total revenue a company can reasonably expect from a single customer over the entire duration of their relationship.Monthly Revenue per Customer: $\$10$Average Customer Lifespan: $12$ monthsLTV $= \text{Monthly Revenue per Customer} \times \text{Average Customer Lifespan}$LTV $= \$10 \times 12 = \$120$$\text{The estimated lifetime value of one customer is **\$120**}.$3. LTV:CAC RatioThe LTV:CAC ratio is a key metric that shows the return on investment (ROI) for customer acquisition. It indicates how much money a business generates for every dollar spent to acquire a 
customer.LTV: $\$120$CAC: $\$50$LTV:CAC Ratio $= \frac{\text{LTV}}{\text{CAC}}$LTV:CAC Ratio $= \frac{\$120}{\$50} = 2.4\times$$\text{The LTV:CAC ratio is **2.4:1** (or **2.4x**).}$üéØ
Goal Analysis:A common benchmark for a healthy Software as a Service (SaaS) or subscription-based business model is an LTV:CAC ratio of 3:1 or higher.
Your calculated ratio of 2.4:1 is good, as the customer's lifetime value is more than double the cost to acquire them.It indicates that for every $\$1$ spent on marketing, your AI agent is expected to bring in
$\$2.40$ in revenue over the customer's lifetime, which is a profitable model.To reach the 3:1 benchmark, you would need to either:Reduce CAC (e.g., lower it to $\approx\$40$ while maintaining $LTV=\$120$).
Increase LTV (e.g., raise the price to $\$12.50$/month or extend the average lifespan to $15$ months while maintaining $CAC=\$50$).



Pro Challenge: Define Your North Star Metric

Pick a real or fictional product.

Ask:

What value do users get?

What action proves they‚Äôre getting that value?

Define your NSM and related ‚Äúsupport metrics.‚Äù

Example:

Product: SkillBoost (online learning app)

NSM: Lessons completed per user

Support Metrics: Course starts, active users, completion rate

üéØ Goal: Find one metric that captures your product‚Äôs purpose.

North Star Metric (NSM) Definition

Product: AI Agent for Healing Anxious Attachment

Question

Answer

1. What core value do users get?

Users gain emotional regulation, reduced relationship-related anxiety, and a move toward a more secure attachment style. The ultimate value is measurably improved emotional health and relationship security.

2. What action proves they‚Äôre getting that value?

The user consistently engages with the deep, structured therapeutic features (not just casual chat). They complete the guided cognitive-behavioral exercises and log their feelings, indicating they are actively working through their anxious patterns.

The North Star Metric (NSM)

The NSM must capture both the frequency of therapeutic action and the intent to improve.

North Star Metric (NSM):

$$\text{Average Number of Core Guided Sessions (Reflections or Coping Drills) Completed per User, per Week}$$

Justification:

This metric focuses on the core activity that drives positive outcomes (healing). Simple active users can just be chatting, but completing a guided session confirms the user is engaging with the product's therapeutic methodology, which is the mechanism for value delivery.

Supporting Metrics (Input Metrics)

These are the levers the team controls to influence the NSM. Improving these metrics should directly cause the NSM to rise.

Metric

Category

Why it Matters

1. Session Completion Rate

Product Health

The percentage of users who start a guided session and finish it. (A low rate suggests bad UX/poor guidance).

2. D7/D30 Retention Rate

Engagement

The percentage of users who return after 7 or 30 days. (Users won't heal if they don't return consistently).

3. Core Feature Adoption

Product Health

Percentage of users who utilize the "Emotional Log" feature (a key diagnostic tool) at least 3 times per week.

4. Time-to-First-Session-Completion

Activation

Measures the time elapsed between sign-up and a user completing their first guided session. (Faster activation leads to better long-term engagement).

5. De-escalation Tool Usage

Safety/Value

Number of times the "Emergency De-escalation" tool is triggered and successfully logged (lower is often better, but indicates high value in crisis).
