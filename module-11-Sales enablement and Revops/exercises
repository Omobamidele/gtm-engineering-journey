Intermediate Exercise: Create a Sales Playbook Page

In a Google Doc or Notion page, outline:

Target Persona: Who are we selling to?

Opening Line / Hook

Key Value Proposition (3 points)

Top 3 Objections + Responses

Call-to-Action (next step)


Sales Playbook Page: Operational Efficiency & Speed

Target Persona: The Efficiency Driver

Role: Director/VP of Business Operations or IT Director (Mid-Market: 100-500 employees)

Key Drivers:

Time-to-Value (TTV): Needs solutions that deploy fast, often measured in hours, not weeks.

Cost Containment: Focused on high ROI; current automation platforms (like Zapier or Make) are becoming prohibitively expensive due to high task volume.

Governance/Control: Needs visibility and control over all integrations to avoid "shadow IT" and security risks.

Pain Points:

Too many manual workflows that require repetitive human intervention.

Current "easy" automation tools can't handle complex conditional logic or nested flows without becoming fragile.

The setup process for new integrations is slow, requiring dedicated developer time or extensive tutorials.

Opening Line / Hook

"I noticed youâ€™re focused on scaling your operations without exponentially scaling your integration costs or waiting weeks for deployment. Most of our clients cut their typical setup time from 5 days down to 10 minutes on complex, multi-step workflows.

Question: Whatâ€™s the single biggest automation backlog item thatâ€™s currently slowing down your team?"

Key Value Proposition (The "3-Point Pitch")

ðŸš€ Instant ROI & Deployment Speed: Go from idea to live, working automation in under 10 minutes. Our visual, guided setup eliminates the slow, confusing integration steps required by legacy platforms.

ðŸ’° Predictable Scale: Cut integration costs by 40% (or more) with our transparent, volume-based pricing model, specifically designed to scale with your business without surprise overages.

ðŸ§  Intelligent Workflow Design: Empower your Operations team to build truly advanced, multi-branch, and conditional logic flows in a single visual interface, eliminating the need for developer-level scripting.

Top 3 Objections + Responses

Objection 1: "We are already heavily invested in Zapier/Make. Why switch?"

Response: "Thatâ€™s common, and we don't expect you to rip and replace everything overnight. Where we shine is on net-new, high-volume, or complex workflows where youâ€™re currently paying a premium. Let us prove our value on your most expensive or time-consuming integration. Use us as the strategic engine for your future, critical automations while maintaining your current stack."

Objection 2: "Another tool means another learning curve for my team."

Response: "Thatâ€™s the exact frustration we solved. Our platform features the 10-minute setup guarantee you saw earlier. We focused intensely on UX to reduce training time drastically. Think of it less as a new tool and more as the intuitive upgrade to your automation capabilities. Your team is productive immediately."

Objection 3: "Weâ€™ve had security issues with integration platforms before. How is your data handling secured?"

Response: "Security is non-negotiable. We are SOC 2 Type II compliant, and all data transmission uses end-to-end encryption. Importantly, we offer dedicated VPCs (Virtual Private Clouds) for customers with sensitive data requirements, a feature often unavailable or prohibitively expensive on comparable platforms. Your data stays isolated and secure."

Call-to-Action (Next Step)

"Instead of just talking about it, letâ€™s schedule a complimentary 15-minute 'Build Session' next week. Bring one of your current manual processes, and we will build and activate a working automation for you live on our platform. You'll walk away with a tangible solution."

Advanced Exercise: Map Your RevOps Funnel

In a diagram or spreadsheet, map:
Marketing â†’ Lead â†’ MQL â†’ SQL â†’ Opportunity â†’ Closed-Won â†’ Renewal

Then:

Define who owns each stage (Marketing, Sales, or CS).

Identify one friction point (e.g., handoff delay).

Suggest one automation to fix it (e.g., auto-assign new SQLs).


RevOps Funnel Stages and Ownership

The revenue journey flows through seven key stages, each with a specific owner and primary goal:

1. Marketing

Owner: Marketing

Primary Goal: Generate broad awareness and demand; acquire initial contacts.

2. Lead

Owner: Marketing

Primary Goal: Qualify and nurture initial contacts (e.g., content consumption, website visits).

3. MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead)

Owner: Marketing, transitioning to Sales Handoff

Primary Goal: Convert leads who show sales-ready behavior.

4. SQL (Sales Qualified Lead)

Owner: Sales

Primary Goal: Validate fit (BANT/MEDDIC) and qualify the prospect for a deeper engagement.

5. Opportunity

Owner: Sales

Primary Goal: Drive the deal through pipeline stages (Demo, Proposal, Negotiation).

6. Closed-Won

Owner: Sales, transitioning to Customer Success Handoff

Primary Goal: Secure the contract and ensure a smooth transition to activation.

7. Renewal/Expansion

Owner: Customer Success (CS)

Primary Goal: Drive customer health, retention, and identify growth opportunities (upsell/cross-sell).

ðŸ›‘ Friction Points and Automation Solutions

Here are the key points where revenue velocity slows down, along with the automation solutions your tool provides to fix them:

Friction Point: Lead â†’ MQL

The Problem (Friction Point): Inconsistent Scoring. Manual or rigid lead scoring misses real-time buyer intent, leading to unqualified MQLs burdening the sales team.

The Fix (Suggested Automation Solution): Intelligent Behavioral Scoring. Automation listens for high-intent signals (e.g., viewing pricing 3x in 24 hours + downloading a competitive comparison guide) and instantly updates the lead score in the CRM, prioritizing high-value MQLs.

Friction Point: MQL â†’ SQL

The Problem (Friction Point): Handoff Delay (The "Golden Hour"). Time lag (even 1-2 hours) between MQL creation and the Sales Rep's first follow-up, causing cold leads.

The Fix (Suggested Automation Solution): Instant SQL Assignment & Alerting. When a lead hits the MQL threshold, the system auto-assigns it to the correct rep (using territory/round-robin logic), creates a high-priority task, and immediately triggers an SMS/Slack alert for the rep to follow up within 5 minutes.

Friction Point: SQL â†’ Opportunity

The Problem (Friction Point): Lack of Pre-Call Intelligence. Sales Reps waste valuable time researching the prospect's tech stack, company news, and key contacts before the first call.

The Fix (Suggested Automation Solution): Automated Prospect Brief Generation. Upon SQL creation, automation pulls data from internal systems and third-party tools (e.g., intent data), summarizing key details (Pain Points, Competitor Use, Financial Health) into a concise "Pre-Call Briefing" document delivered to the rep's inbox.

Friction Point: Opportunity â†’ Closed-Won

The Problem (Friction Point): Contract Stalls. Final steps (legal review, contract generation) are manual, prone to error, and slow down time-to-close.

The Fix (Suggested Automation Solution): Auto-Generated Contract Workflow. When the Opportunity stage moves to 'Verbal Commit,' the system uses the deal data (products, pricing) to instantly generate a legally approved contract PDF, uploads it to Docusign/Echosign, and notifies the internal legal team for approval.

Friction Point: Closed-Won â†’ Renewal

The Problem (Friction Point): Onboarding Disconnect. Information silo between Sales and Customer Success (CS) leads to the CS team starting from scratch, causing a poor customer experience.

The Fix (Suggested Automation Solution): Seamless CS Handoff & Project Creation. On 'Closed-Won,' automation syncs all relevant Sales notes and deal files into the CS project management platform (e.g., Jira/Asana), creates the customer health record, and auto-schedules the initial Customer Success Manager (CSM) kickoff call.

Design a RevOps Dashboard

Core RevOps Performance Dashboard

This dashboard focuses on three critical metricsâ€”one from the top, middle, and bottom of the funnelâ€”to provide a quick health check of the entire revenue operation.

1. Top-of-Funnel Health (Marketing)

Metric: Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)

Definition: Volume of leads passing initial qualification (e.g., scoring high enough for handover).

Owner: Marketing Team

Source System: HubSpot (or equivalent Marketing Automation Platform)

Reporting Frequency: Weekly

Current Trend: Rising (â†‘)

Insight: Marketing is successfully filling the pipeline. Focus shifts to ensuring the quality of these MQLs as they transition to Sales.

2. Mid-Funnel Efficiency (Sales)

Metric: Win Rate

Definition: Percentage of Opportunities that convert to Closed-Won deals.

Owner: Sales Team

Source System: Salesforce (or equivalent CRM)

Reporting Frequency: Weekly (rolling average)

Current Trend: Decreasing (â†“)

Insight: The declining Win Rate signals a friction point in the middle of the funnel. This suggests issues with: 1) MQL quality (Marketing is sending poor leads), 2) Sales effectiveness, or 3) Competitiveness/Pricing. Immediate attention is needed here.

3. Post-Sale Health (Customer Success)

Metric: Churn Rate

Definition: Percentage of customers or revenue lost over a defined period.

Owner: Customer Success (CS) Team

Source System: Stripe (or equivalent Billing/Subscription Management System)

Reporting Frequency: Monthly

Current Trend: Stable (â†”)

Insight: Churn is stable, which is good, but any loss impacts long-term growth. Continuous focus should be on improving onboarding (as discussed in the funnel map) and proactive customer health checks to prevent future leaks.
