Beginner Exercise: Find Where Your Customers Hang Out

Write down your Ideal Customer (example: “Marketing managers in small tech startups”).

Google or search on social media:

What sites, platforms, or communities do they use?

What kind of content do they interact with?

SOLUTION
Ideal Customer: Real estate companies, including individual agents, brokers, and larger firms, who want to improve efficiency and client experience through automation. Specific targets include decision-makers like brokers and owners, as well as agents who can use AI for tasks like client communication, property listing optimization, and lead management.

Platform	Why They’re There	Example Content
LinkedIn	Professional networking, B2B connections, industry news, establishing credibility, and professional development.	Posts on market insights, commercial real estate trends, successful case studies, best practices for lead generation, and business/technology articles (e.g., "5 Ways AI is Automating Client Follow-up").

Facebook Groups	Niche community building, sharing tips, asking for advice/referrals, and engaging with peers on practical, day-to-day challenges. (e.g., "Lab Coat Agents," local real estate agent groups)	Questions about lead generation systems, discussions on new technology tools, requests for contract advice, posts about overcoming common agent hurdles, and discussions about brokerage management.

YouTube	Learning/tutorials for marketing, technology, and sales tactics; staying current on market analysis and business growth strategies.	"How-to" videos on social media marketing for agents, property video tour examples, interviews with top producers, software demos (e.g., "Best Real Estate CRM Walkthrough"), and economic/market forecast analysis.

Industry-Specific Forums/Communities (e.g., ActiveRain, BiggerPockets (for investors/agents), Realtor.com forums)	Connecting with other professionals, seeking specific advice, sharing expertise, and discussing industry-specific topics in depth.	Detailed discussions on commission splits, best marketing practices, reviews of real estate tech/software, and ethical/legal questions.
