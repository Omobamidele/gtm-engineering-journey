SOLUTION

FOR MY FICTONAL AI TOOL 
fictional product: An AI first-line writer based on a person's LinkedIn profile.

1. Create the Waitlist Page üìù
Action: Design a simple, high-impact page to capture interest and collect emails. Instead of just an email field, include one crucial qualifying question to help segment your early audience.

Tool: Use Typeform or Google Form. Typeform is generally better for a polished, engaging user experience.

Due Date: October 25

Key Question to Include: "How many personalized cold outreach messages do you send on LinkedIn each week?" (This helps identify your most active and valuable early adopters).

2. Make the Teaser Post üì¢
Action: Craft a short, benefit-focused post for your primary channel, LinkedIn. The goal is to highlight the core pain point your product solves (generic outreach) and introduce the solution (hyper-personalized AI first lines).

Tool: LinkedIn

Due Date: October 25

The 3-Line Post Draft:

Stop writing generic outreach. We're building an AI that analyzes any LinkedIn profile (posts, skills, experience) and generates a hyper-personalized first line that guarantees a double-take. ü§Ø

The days of "Found your profile interesting" are over. Join the private beta waitlist here: [LINK TO WAITLIST]

3. Collect 10 Signups (Mini-Audience Building) ü§ù
Action: Move beyond just posting. Manually share the waitlist link with people who fit the ideal user profile (sales, recruiters, B2B marketers) to ensure your first 10 signups are high-quality.

Tool/Channel: Personal Network & Targeted Communities.

Due Date: November 1

Execution Focus:

Direct Outreach: Message 5-10 connections working in sales, recruiting, or content and ask them directly to sign up, framing it as a request for their expert feedback.

Community Sharing: Post the link in two highly relevant Slack, Discord, or private Facebook groups dedicated to lead generation, outbound sales, or copywriting. Do not spam; frame it as an exclusive invite.

4. Send the "Launch Coming Soon" Email üìß
Action: Send a brief but exciting email to the 10+ people who signed up. This re-engages the audience, reinforces the value, and sets the expectation for the next phase (the private beta).

Tool: Gmail (for a small, personal audience) or a simple email service like MailerLite.

Due Date: November 4

Content Focus: Thank them for joining, reiterate the core promise ("Get 3x the replies with AI-driven personalization"), and announce the exact date or week the private beta will open.


Launch Day Checklist: AI First-Line Writer
üéØ Goal: Organize and execute launch tasks clearly to drive initial signups and feature usage.
Morning Momentum (9:00 AM - 1:00 PM EST)
‚úÖ Publish website: Your very first action. Flip the switch on the main marketing site and ensure the sign-up/onboarding flow is fully functional and live for incoming users.

‚úÖ Post on Product Hunt: Submit the pre-drafted product listing. Make sure the headline and description clearly communicate the core value: "AI-powered, hyper-personalized first lines for outreach." Immediately engage with the first two commenters.

‚úÖ Announce on LinkedIn + Twitter: Post the detailed, high-energy launch announcement on LinkedIn (your priority channel for B2B). Post a punchier, condensed version on Twitter, driving traffic to your new site.

‚úÖ Send email to list: Send the "We Are LIVE!" email to your waitlist. This email should be brief, exciting, and include a single, prominent Call to Action (CTA) button to start the free trial.

‚úÖ Personal Network Outreach: Send 10 direct, personal messages to key industry friends, recruiters, or sales leaders who promised to support the launch, asking them to check out the product and share their thoughts.

Afternoon Engagement & Monitoring (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM EST)
‚úÖ Check analytics (Google Analytics): Monitor traffic sources, sign-up conversions, and feature usage. Identify which channels are driving the best traffic (likely LinkedIn or Product Hunt) and note any high drop-off points in the sign-up flow.

‚úÖ Respond to every comment: Dedicate time slots to respond to every single comment on Product Hunt, LinkedIn, and Twitter. High engagement is critical for both ranking and building early user loyalty.

‚úÖ Community Post: Announce the launch in 2-3 highly relevant external communities (e.g., Slack or Discord groups focused on B2B sales, recruiting, or growth marketing), framing it as an exclusive tool for members.

‚úÖ Tally & Triage Feedback: Create a running document of all incoming user feedback, feature requests, and bug reports. This ensures the product team knows exactly what to focus on tomorrow.

Evening Wrap-up (5:00 PM onwards)
‚úÖ Launch Day Summary Post: Write a brief, grateful post for LinkedIn and Product Hunt, highlighting a small victory (e.g., "Hit 100 signups today!" or "Thank you for getting us to the top 5!").

‚úÖ Prepare Follow-up: Schedule a unique, value-focused post for the next morning (Day 2) to catch users in different time zones or those who missed the initial flood of launch announcements.
