| Launch = Hype + Timing + Coordination | It’s not random — it’s engineered    |
| Always plan in 4 phases               | Prep → Build → Launch → Learn        |
| Pre-launch matters most               | Warm your audience early             |
| Focus on learnings, not perfection    | You’ll relaunch smarter              |
| Launch is a loop                      | Every product gets multiple launches |
